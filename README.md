# EmailSenderProgram
This program requires you to turn off safety measures of your google account such as:
2-step verification
captcha lock
and also you will have to enable low secure app access.

This all is necessary because we need to allow a java program to compose and send an email using the gmail server which is highly protected by google ofcourse

also do not forget to add the given .jar files as dependencies to this code in your IDE
